# Single-cell Expression Atlas - compatible analysis bundles from annData files

In the Gene Expression team at the EBI we produce [Single Cell Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/home) (SCXA), using a consistent pipeline to analyse data from the raw FASTQ files and produce the results visibile in the SCXA interface. Intermediate in this process is an 'analysis bundle' whereby the subset of results needed are gathered and formatted correctly for loading into our databases and indices. 

We sometimes encounter datasets without raw data, but where the user has an [annData](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) file containing expression matrices and derived results. The purpose of this repository is to provide a way of producing an analysis bundle directly from an annData object, allowing us (with some manual curation) to input these experiments. It will also be useful to simplify our own processes, since we can take the annData files now produced at the end of our analysis to produce a bundle in one step.

This is the implementation of an [internal strategy document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sdy9iOHKXUz8dEv66v1Cu77626_w2KuJ2myapWIN5So/edit#heading=h.mdsu1vbn6spl).

## Analysis bundles

### What make an analysis bundle?

An SCXA analysis bundle contains:

 - MTX-format expression matrices (raw, filtered, normalised)
 - TSV-format cell metadata used in analysis
 - TSV-format gene metadata used in analysis
 - TSV-format dimension reductions of different parameterisation (t-SNE, UMAP)
 - An annData-format file containing all the above
 - Reference files (GTF, cDNA) used in analysis
 - A software report detailing tools and versions used
 - A manifest file containing all the above

## Process outline

The steps required to produce a bundle are:

 1. Initialise the bundle (`init` step). Process the annData file to determine what information is available and tore a summary of this information in a YAML-format configuration file (`anndata-config.yaml` in the bundle directory), and us that to Generate bundle files (1st time) based on the starting config files in 1. 
 2. Examine the cell metadata files and use that information to refine configuration related to cell metadata. This includes flagging fields that should be included in the pre-MAGE-TAB files, and for droplet experiments, finding the field that separates cells from different libraries. Also check the gene metadata at this stage, to check that Ensembl gene identifiers are available.
 3. Initialise MAGE-TAB (`init_magetab` step). Generate bundle files (2nd time) based on configuration refined in 2.. This will include pre-MAGE-TAB files suitable as a basis for curation.
 4. Undertake curation based on pre-magetab files generated at 3.
 5. Inject curated metadata into the annData object and configuration (`inject_magetab` step). Condense the new SDRF file (including zoomification) and inject the new metadata back into the annData object where it can be used in curation. Output a new configuration that includes any new fields added in curation.
 6. Make final edits to the config YAML. Complete anything marked with FILL ME, set the `load_to_scxa_db` matrix and flag any e.g. cell type fields for marker generation.
 7. Generate the final bundle suitable for loading into SCXA (`final` step).

Once finalised, the config YAML should be added to the `scxa_metadata` repo alongside the MAGE-TAB files.

## Role of curators and bioinformaticians

The process is progressive, with information on an experiment gradulally being accumulated for potential partial analysis and loading. Steps 1-5 could be undertaken by curators, with the bundle and configuration then being handed off to bionformaticians. However additional author-provided information (e.g. on matrix processing) is likely to be needed at step 6, and it may be that that information could be gathered from authors alongside curation in step 4.

## Protocol: producing an analysis bundle from arbitrary annData files

### 0. Install this package

This repository contains a python packages which should be used to facilitate production of a bundle. 

Probably the simplest install method is with Conda (or Mamba). e.g. to create a new environment with the package:

```
conda create -n atlas-anndata atlas-anndata
```

OR install it from PyPi like:

```
pip install atlas-anndata
```

The `make_bundle_from_anndata` script is the central utility over which a bundle is created over the steps above. The usage is:

```
Usage: make_bundle_from_anndata [OPTIONS] EXP_NAME

```

(Note that the `atlas-style` flag is probably only useful for annData files produced by the Experession Atlas team, and relies on a number of assumptions about the content of the file in order to infer some additional information.)

### 1. Bundle initialisation: Produce a YAML format annData description file and starting bundle content

To produce a valid bundle from an anndata file, we need to describe that file, outlining which of the cell/ gene metadata columns, matrices,dimension reductions etc should be included. This is done via a YAML-format config file (see [example](atlas_anndata/data/bundles/E-MTAB-6077/anndata-config.yaml)). Then produce a starting bundle based on that config. 

Both of these things are accomplished by 'make_starting_config_from_anndata` with the 'init' step:

```
make_bundle_from_anndata --anndata-file atlas_anndata/data/bundles/E-MTAB-6077/E-MTAB-6077.project.h5ad E-MTAB-6077 init
``` 

(note: we would supply `--droplet` at this stage for a droplet experiment).

This will create a starting bundle, by default in the current directory (see `--bundle-dir`), including a starting version of the bundle configuration and a copy of the annData file which we will eventually customise and distribute:

```
> tree E-MTAB-6077/
E-MTAB-6077/
????????? anndata-config.yaml
????????? E-MTAB-6077.cell_metadata.tsv
????????? E-MTAB-6077.project.h5ad
????????? MANIFEST
????????? reference
    ????????? gene_annotation.txt

1 directory, 5 files
```

The config is likely to wrong in a number of ways, but its just a starting point. 

### 2: refine configuration for curation

With the configuration file and unmoderated content available to us we can make some sensible decisions about some of those settings in the YAML file.

#### Identify correct gene ID and gene name fields

For SCXA we need the gene symbol and ID fields. The configuration YAML might have populated these if the default field names are present, but you may well get:

```
gene_meta:
  id_field: FILL ME with a string
  name_field: FILL ME with a string
```

You need to look at the `reference/gene_annotation.txt` file from the bundle directory and set these fields. `id_field` **must** be a field containing Ensembl gene IDs. If these are not available we cannot work with a dataset. `name_field` is a field containing gene symbols.

### Sample field (droplet experiments only)

The sample field is encoded in the config generated above like:

```
  sample_field: FILL ME with a string
```

The value of this configuration field must be a field name from NONAME.cell_metadata.tsv in the bundle directory corresponding to a field that separates cells from different libraries.The `sample` field in this file is usually derived from the cell identifiers, and should only be used in the absence of more concrete information.

### 3: Initialise MAGE-TAB

Starting MAGE-TAB content can now be generated with the `init_magetab` step of `make_bundle_from_anndata`:

```
make_bundle_from_anndata E-MTAB-6077 init_magetab
```

The experiment name ('E-MTAB-6077' here) and step ('init_magetab') must be supplied. The annData and configuration will be read from the bundle directory, assumed by default to be in the current working directory (see above).

### 4: Do curation

The pre-MAGE-TAB can now be used to start curation by the curation team. Assuming contact with authors is occurring at this point, it would save time if the information needed at step 6 could also be gathered here, such as the processing status of component matrices. Otherwise the appropriate contact should be passed to bioinformaticians, who will need this info prior to producing the final bundle.

### 5. Inject curated metadata 

MAGE-TAB format metadata should now be available in the `scxa-metadata` repository, from where we can retrieve it to be condensed, zoomified, and added to the annData object. This can all be done with another run of `make_bundle_from_anndata`:

```
make_bundle_from_anndata E-MTAB-6077 inject_magetab
```

This will pull the curated metadata from the `scxa-metadata` repo, condense the SDRF (adding ontology terms) and re-generate cell-wise annotations that will be used to enrich the content of the annData file, with any new fields from curation added to `.obs`. It will also add configuration for those fields to the YAML.

Not that `--conda-prefix` can be spedified here, and is a location conda environments will be stored for the workflow that does SDRF condensation etc.

### 6. Finalise configuration

We're almost ready to creat our final bundle, but we must first finalise all the configuration in `anndata-config.yaml` for the bundle.

#### Flag curated fields

Cell meta data from annData objects is a mixture of any input sample metadata provided by the author, plus annotations added over the course of analysis. The latter may not be appropriate for inclusion in the metadata in SCXA. Check the fields described in `cell_meta`, especially their kind ('curation', 'clustering', 'analysis'). Curated fields are those present before analysis, biological and technical info for cells and samples. Clustering is used to indicate the results of unsupervised cell clustering stored in .obs. Analysis is everthing else, comprising all other fields added to .obs during analysis.

Most importantly: 

 - Flip `curation` to `analysis` for any field entry which should not ultimately form part of the SCXA experiment MAGE-TAB format metadata.
 - Ensure any fields corresponding to unsupervised clusterings are flagged correctly.

#### Gather other missing info needed before final bundle creation

Unlike our standard submission pathways, for pre-analysed data we need additional information before the data are ingested for SCXA, which must currently be provided via the configuration YAML. The completed config from the following steps should be added to the `scxa-metadata` alongside the MAGE-TAB files.

 - Under analyses please describe the analysis that was done. At a minimum you should describe the reference used (see [the example](atlas_anndata/example_config.yaml)) and the mapping tool used.
 - Under `matrices` check that you want all these matrices to be considered. You can remove any matrix that's not useful, and you should check the processing flags / matrices for each one. 
 - Under load_to_scxa_db please state the matrix that should be used by Atlas in expression-based displays. This should be filtered and normalised but not scaled or transformed. If no matrix in the object matches these criteria please remove this part of the config and Atlas will not show displays for this experiment based on expression values.
 - Check the dimension reductions described, again paying attention to 'kind'. 

For all sections, check [the example](atlas_anndata/data/bundles/E-MTAB-6077/anndata-config.yaml) for an idea of how things should look. For example under `matrices` there will be an entry pertaining the content of .X. You shold add a name (e.g 'scaled'), and check that the status of all the boolean flags is correct. This may well require some queries to the authors.

```
  - cell_filtered: true
    gene_filtered: true
    log_transformed: true
    measure: counts
    name: FILL ME with a string
    normalised: true
    parameters: {}
    scaled: true
    slot: X
```

You would fill the 'name' field here with something more descriptive for the matrix.

### Mark cell metadata fields for marker detection

Any categorical field can be used for marker detection (where appropriate matrices are available). This involves flipping the 'marker' status on a field annotation, e.g. changing:

```
  - default: false
    kind: clustering
    markers: true
    parameters: {}
    slot: leiden
```

... to 

```
  - default: false
    kind: clustering
    markers: false
    parameters: {}
    slot: leiden
```

#### Validate config YAML

Having edited the config YAML, you should validate it against a schema we provide and the annData file itself. We can use this mechanism to ensure that inputs match the expectations of Single Cell Expression Atlas. 

```
validate_anndata_with_config E-MTAB-6077
```

This will check that the config in the bundle directory for this experiment matches with the modified annData object there.

Bundling steps will also run this automatically before proceeding, but running it yourself will flag any issues early. If the validation flags any issues, resolve them.


### 7: Final bundle run

With the configuration finalised, it's just a case of running the `final` step for `make_bundle_from_anndata`:

```
make_bundle_from_anndata E-MTAB-6077 final
```

All bundle content including matrices, dimension reductionss etc will be written, and this should form the final bundle that can be read by SCXA loading processes.
